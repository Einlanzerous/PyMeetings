# PyMeetings
Just a basic attendance tool I created to play around with PyQt5 GUI

Use the Powershell part to schedule a job, and then have it pick up the needed file and e-mail to whomever takes attendance. I did this on a delay so that users that pop in late don't cause multiple e-mails to be sent. Figured this was the easiest way to hide these things behind the scenes.
